# Hello there !

I'm the manual tester with above one year non commercial experience based on my own determination to studying and participate in projects, which helped me consolidate my knowledge as a tester.
I'm reading the industry books for learn new things which can be helpful to exercise in the profession.
I'm usually learning with courses about frameworks and tools what I need.
Currently I'm taking my first steps in the automation with Java and Selenium.


## Courses:

**Practice workshop by Testerzy.pl**
It's a 30 practice exercises that solidified my theory about manual testing.
All of these tasks have names that correspond to the individual stages of the tester's work so you can review what you want.
