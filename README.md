# Hello there !

I'm the manual tester with above one year non commercial experience based on my own determination to studying and participate in projects, which helped me consolidate my knowledge as a tester.
I'm reading the industry books for learn new things which can be helpful to exercise in the profession.
I'm usually learning with courses about frameworks and tools what I need.
Currently I'm taking my first steps in the automation with Java and Selenium.
